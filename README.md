"Many school transportation systems in Mira Bhayandar operate without real-time vehicle tracking or route optimization. Parents have no live updates on bus locations, and inefficient bus routing increases fuel consumption, commute time, and traffic congestion near schools. There is a need to improve safety, reduce carbon footprint, and streamline school logistics"
